In this work, we propose a <strong>Block Map (BM)</strong> generation and maintenance method and the corresponding BM-based localization system. The main contributions are as follows:

- A BM-based localization system in a large-scale environment is proposed for the first time.
- A BM generation method and corresponding switching strategy is proposed which maintains the spatial continuity of adjacent BMs.
- A factor graph-based optimization method with the dynamic sliding window based on BMs is proposed to achieve accurate and reliable state estimation.
- We achieve the best performance on publicly available large-scale datasets [NCLT](https://robots.engin.umich.edu/nclt/) and [M2DGR](https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/M2DGR).
